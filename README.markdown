# Tensorflow.js Smart Webcam

This project creates a webpage that uses machine learning directly in the web browser via TensorFlow.js to classify and detect common objects (including more than one at a time) from a live webcam stream in real time. Not only will we know that the image contains an object, but we can also get the coordinates of the bounding box for each object it finds, which allows you to highlight the found object in the image.

The webcam can detect objects like people, animals, devices, and foods. Try holding a common object up to your webcam and see if the program can correctly identify it.
