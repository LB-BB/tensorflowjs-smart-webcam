What is Tensorflow.js?

TensorFlow.js is an open source machine learning library that can run anywhere JavaScript can. It's based upon the original TensorFlow library written in Python and aims to re-create this developer experience and set of APIs for the JavaScript ecosystem.

Google has a collection of pre-trained models, some of which offer transfer learning capabilities (ex. a model that originally trained on cats can be retrained to recognize dogs).
The pretrained model I used is called COCO-SSD. It can locate the bounding-box of objects it has been trained to find.

About COCO-SSD

COCO-SSD is doing a lot of heavy lifting behind the scenes. It can take any browser-based image element (<img>, <video>, <canvas>) and return an array of bounding boxes with class name and confidence level.
